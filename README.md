#  Firebase Authentication in Jetpack Compose

> AuthLogin is a sample app to demonstrate the implementation of single sign on using Firebase Authentication through different service providers (Google, and Anonymous), and link between them.

## Project overview
Most apps now need to securely authenticate user’s identity, and save user’s data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the user’s devices (across different platforms too).

Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. 
It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more.
